<h1>Module 1 - Exercise 1 (John Deere)</h1>

<p><b>The Old Deere</b></p>

<p>In fields of gold and skies so clear, <br>
    An old John Deere, year after year. <br>
    Rust on the hood, no cab to shield, <br>
    Yet still it toils in every field.<br></p>

<p>Aged by time, but strong at heart, <br>
    Its engine hums, a work of art. <br>
    Through sun and rain, it ploughs the ground, <br>
    A faithful friend, so steadfast, sound.<br></p>
    
<p>With every turn, a story told, <br>
    Of seasons past and futures bold. <br>
    Though paint may fade, its spirit stays, <br>
    In every furrow, it leaves its praise.<br></p>
    
<p>Rusty and worn, yet never still, <br>
    An old John Deere with iron will.<br>
     It works the land, from dawn till dusk, <br>
     A timeless bond, in dust and musk.</p>
