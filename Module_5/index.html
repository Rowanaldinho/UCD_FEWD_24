        Sport Ireland has welcomed the publication of the government's 'Major international sports events policy and strategy framework', which aims to promote Ireland as a host for major sporting events.
        Minister for sport, Catherine Martin, and minister of state for sport, Thomas Byrne, today published the strategy, which "seeks to build on Ireland's success in hosting major international sports events to date".
        The framework sets out a strategic approach to bidding for major international sports events and maximising the benefits of such events whenever Ireland hosts them.
        It says that "Hosting a major international sport event has the potential to deliver a range of benefits and opportunities, while simultaneously, having the potential to be costly and risky. Benefits can range from a short-term economic boost through direct tourism to longer-term sporting, social and economic benefits."

        The framework identifies '15 guiding principles' to help the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media in determining whether it should support potential bids, including the proviso that there should be no more than two 'mega events' in any five-year period.
        "It is important that when we invest in major sports events we are clear about the benefits we wish to achieve from that investment," said minister Martin.
        "Sport-related tourism is a very significant element of world tourism, with a multi-million euro market and a huge potential for countries who position themselves correctly. Major international sports events provide a unique opportunity to highlight the island of Ireland as a wonderful holiday destination, as well as a top location for sporting events."
