    <p>New Zealand have been dealt a double blow ahead of Friday's clash with Ireland at Aviva Stadium, with Beauden Barrett and Codie Taylor both ruled out of the World Cup quarter-final rematch due to concussion.
        <br>
        <br>
        The pair suffered head injuries during yesterday’s 24-22 win against England, with head coach Scott Robertson already confirming they would miss the trip to Dublin, given they are dealing with a six-day turnaround.
        <br>
        <br>
        Meanwhile, Ireland are continuing their training camp in Portugal where they have been joined by Peter O’Mahony, who now looks well in contention for a place in Andy Farrell’s matchday squad.
        <br>
        <br>
        The 35-year-old played the first half of Munster’s 38-24 defeat to the All Blacks XV at Thomond Park on Saturday evening on his comeback from a hamstring injury, before coming off at half-time in a pre-arranged substitution.
        <br>
        <br>
        Ireland are due to return from Portugal on Tuesday, but assistant coach Andrew Goodman confirmed the flanker has already joined the camp on the Algarve.
        <br>
        <br>
        "We're all in good health and training away, obviously," the attack coach (below) said.
