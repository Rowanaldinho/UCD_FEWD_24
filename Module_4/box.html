    <p>New Zealand have been dealt a double blow ahead of Friday's clash with Ireland at Aviva Stadium, with Beauden Barrett and Codie Taylor both ruled out of the World Cup quarter-final rematch due to concussion.</p>
    <p>The pair suffered head injuries during yesterdays 24-22 win against England, with head coach Scott Robertson already confirming they would miss the trip to Dublin, given they are dealing with a six-day turnaround.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, Ireland are continuing their training camp in Portugal where they have been joined by Peter Oâ€™Mahony, who now looks well in contention for a place in Andy Farrells matchday squad.</p>
